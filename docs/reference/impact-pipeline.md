# IMPACT Example Repository

The [SDN-IMPACT-DTI](https://github.com/DiffusionTensorImaging-Repos/SDN-IMPACT-DTI) repository is a working example of this entire pipeline executed on real data from Project IMPACT at TUBRIC. Every preprocessing step has been run on 55 participants with multi-shell diffusion data (CMRR multiband acquisition, b-values: 0, 250, 1000, 2000, 3250, 5000).

You can use it to see what each step's output actually looks like, compare your results against a completed dataset, and reference the exact commands that were used.

## What Is in the Repository

- All 14 preprocessing stages fully executed
- Output files from each stage for all 55 subjects
- QC reports and data tracking
- BIDS conversion and pyAFQ preparation
- Parallelized batch processing scripts
